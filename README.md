This project is one of the first ideas I ever had while learning JS6. The idea was to make an (il)logical reaction structure of how a cat would react to receiving pets on different parts of their body depending on their mood. It is meant to be a very casual, cute, fun oriented website where I show a little bit of my thinking and style!

## How does it work?

The Cat Petting Simulator contains an invisible **Comfyness Counter** where the level of comfyness of the cat is measured with a numeric value. Using the buttons to pet the cat on the different parts of its body, will trigger functions that contain:
  - a logical structure of **if**'s, where depending on the Comfyness Counter value, petting on different parts will have an effect or another
  - an element of randomness implemented by using **Math.Random**, where the result will derivate on new if structures or more "dice throwing".
